325	Humans are blessed with versatility. Their skills are spread evenly between Stamina and Intelligence, and they possess a variety of skills. Humans are well-versed in close-ranged combat but can also learn to effectively wield a bow as well. Once they master their combat skills, Humans can excel at whatever style of combat they desire.
326	Elves are innately skilled at archery and move more quickly than Humans and Giants. They also possess high Intelligence and MP. Elves primarily wield bows and magic, allowing them to attack from a distance. Since Elves can perform long-ranged attacks at a younger age than other races, they have a slight advantage over Humans and Giants.
327	Giants are tall, brawny, and exceptionally strong. They are able to handle powerful weapons that no other race can wield. They are capable melee fighters. Even young, unlearned Giants can hold their own in close quarters combat.
