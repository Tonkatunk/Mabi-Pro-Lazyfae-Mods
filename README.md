# Mabi Pro Lazyfae Mods
 
There is a variety of different mods available here.  You can just download and use all, or pick and choose.  Either way, I strongly recommend you know how to check for outdated mods at the very least, because I will not generally notify and make updates for the public, so much as myself.  So if I'm not active or forget to update via github, crashing is expected.

Link to a guide currently on mabi.pro forums, to finding outdated files.  This doesn't cover manually updating, just seeing if they're a potential problem.<br>

   1.data/db/ai<br>
   *If local/aidescdata_human is the only file, it's an auto-play instrument mod.

   2.data/cutscene<br>
   *skip cutscene mods.  As of 10/20/20, does not include custom content skips.  Should not cause crashing or lock ups on any vanilla content.

   3.data/layout<br>
   *skillcomboprogress.xml will move the Combo Card Display to below your character, instead of above.  I believe this uses absolute values and not relative positions, it's set for 1920x1080 display and may instead cause complications on higher resolutions.
   *characterinfo/main.xml will just rename the tabs on your character sheet, C key by default.
   
   4.data/db/npc<br>
   *Swaps female blunt ego to look like female bow ego.
   
   
   5.data/db/charactercondition.xml<br>
   *Paints Characters in Deadly as red, and Mana Shield as blue.
   
   6.data/db/collectingform.xml<br>
   *Allows infinite range gather from Sheep, Chickens, and Elemental Sprites.  If you are not next to the creature though, the items will drop roughly half the distance between you.
