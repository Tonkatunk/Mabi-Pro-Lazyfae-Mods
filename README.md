# Mabi Pro Lazyfae Mods
 
There is a variety of different mods available here.  You can just download and use all, or pick and choose.  Either way, I strongly recommend you know how to check for outdated mods at the very least, because I will not generally notify and make updates for the public, so much as myself.  So if I'm not active or forget to update via github, crashing is expected.

Link to a guide currently on mabi.pro forums, to finding outdated files.  This doesn't cover manually updating, just seeing if they're a potential problem.
