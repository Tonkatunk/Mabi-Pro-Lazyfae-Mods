# Mabi Pro Lazyfae Mods
 
There is a variety of different mods available here.  You can just download and use all, or pick and choose.  Either way, I strongly recommend you know how to check for outdated mods at the very least, because I will not generally notify and make updates for the public, so much as myself.  So if I'm not active or forget to update via github, crashing is expected.

Link to a guide currently on mabi.pro forums, to finding outdated files.  This doesn't cover manually updating, just seeing if they're a potential problem.

1. data/db/ai<br>
*If local/aidescdata_human is the only file, it's an auto-play instrument mod.


`data/cutscene
skip cutscene mods.  As of 10/20/20, does not include custom content skips.  Should not cause crashing or lock ups on any vanilla content.`
